# APRoundedButton

A simple XIB extension to make rounded custom buttons, without writing one line of code, using **IBInspectable**.

**IBInspectable** properties provide new access to an old feature: user-defined runtime attributes.  
Currently accessible from the identity inspector, these attributes have been available since before  
Interface Builder was integrated into Xcode.  
They provide a powerful mechanism for configuring any key-value coded property of an instance in a NIB, XIB, or storyboard.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.  
Next you can configure your buttons directly from your storyboards/xibs.
